  "title": "Update block.max_gas to 60M for Anchor Lane",
  "summary": "This proposal sets the consensus block.max_gas to 60,000,000 (60M) to enforce the anchor lane capacity limit.\n\nRationale:\n- 60M block gas is calculated for ~100 TPS at 4-second blocks (100 × 4 × 150k avg gas)\n- Combined with max_tx_gas=2M, ensures ~30+ transactions needed to fill a block\n- Prevents single-tx dominance and protects validator resources\n- Leaves 67% headroom for burst absorption at 33% target utilization\n- Enforces protocol-level capacity constraints for anchor lane\n\nThe current value of -1 (unlimited) provides no protection against block bloat attacks.",
